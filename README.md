  <sub>AVX2 may be faster than SSE2 though not all CPUs support it (`Steam > Help > System Information > Processor Information > AVX2`). Freetype uses freetype as the text rasterizer and includes some custom fonts, which results in better looking text but larger DLL sizes. PDBs are for developer use. </sub>
